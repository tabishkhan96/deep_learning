# deep_learning
This repository would be used keep track of my journey in deep learning. Most of the code would in [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) for now.
I would be using the [fastai](http://www.fast.ai) library from Jeremy Howard's fastai course. So you will need to download the fastai library from [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastai).
I would be trying to implement some of fastai's functionality with pytorch from scratch for learning purpose. For some sections, I would keep the amount of abstraction in the code to minimal, so we can get a feeling how all pytorch components fit together.
And from time to time, I would also be doing kaggle's competition problem for practice purpose.

## Getting Started

You need to place the **fastai** library folder under **deep_learning** folder. You can get it from [here](https://github.com/fastai/fastai).
